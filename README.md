# DCM 26
This is the repository for the DCM 26 quantum excercise by Infleqtion.

<p>
This exercise revolves around the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm which is a good example of how 
quantum entanglement and superposition can be harnessed to speed-up some calculations.<br>
In addition to designing your circuits, you will perform a bit of quantum compilation: each quantum 
hardware has a particular qubit layout so the circuits have to be adapted to the quantum 
computer they will be run on. In this case, you will adapt the circuit to SQALE which is Infleqtion's 
neutral atom computer.
